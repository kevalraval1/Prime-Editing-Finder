# Prime-Editing-Finder

This program will find all necessary information required for performing a prime editing experiment given a single mutation site and the desired PAM sequence for CAS9. It also provides variability for PBS length in a range of 7-17. ngRNA Analysis is performed on the mutation site itself and therefore there are 2 top and bottom ngRNA sequences provided in total, one for the plus strand (input strand) and one for the minus strand.
